Example 3.2 (Poisson equation):
Consider the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary condition over Ω = [0,1] × [0,1]:

    Δu(x, y) = f(x, y),    (x, y) ∈ Ω

with boundary conditions:

    u(x, 0) = g1(x),   u(x, 1) = g2(x)
    u(0, y) = h1(y),   u(1, y) = h2(y)

Once an explicit form of u is given, the functions g1, g2, h1, h2, and f can be computed.
